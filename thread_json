I&#039;m trying to save the OS to a USB and boot from that before I mess around with the hard drive, and to see if I like it. I chose Ubuntu because it&#039;s apparently the entry level OS. Used Unetbootin to install and extract to the USB, did a reboot, changed the BIOS settings so it should use Legacy rather than UEFI, changed UEFI so secure start is disabled just in case and set the boot order for booth so USB-CDROM is at the top, and changed USB-3.0 to auto rather than enabled. It takes longer to start up and the screen is blank, which is a sign it&#039;s trying first to do what I&#039;ve set it to(?) but then it still boots the windows OS. No indication of what&#039;s wrong other than it just doesn&#039;t work so I have no idea what to search for. What do /g/?",

I was able to install Debian, but on start up in both regular and safe mode it outputs a lot of lines about Nouveau failing and then a single line about looking for rtl_nic/rtl8168e-3.fw before it crashes. I looked it up and apparently it&#039;s something to do with using a 1GB ethernet cable. But these things shouldn&#039;t be crashing my OS&#039;s, right? I&#039;ve successfully installed all of the OS&#039;s on a laptop, though admittedly not in UEFI because the laptop is old. Is it something to do with my system&#039;s architecture? Pic related is my specs. My CPU tends towards being hot, but not hot enough to short anything. Secure boot and everything related to Windows 8 in start up has been disabled.",
