In at least a very basic sense, could overclocking be comparable to forced induction in cars? CPU frequency could be comparable to the actual volume of air going into the engine, while CPU voltage is comparable to fuel intake. The more air goes into the engine, the more fuel is needed to burn efficiently, but too much fuel results in more heat and wear on the engine (CPU) and can actually hinder performance. Both are sort of finding the most efficient fuel\/air frequency\/voltage ratio to work at it&#039;s best. The better cooling you have in both cases, the more you can throw at it.
