The number of OpenBSD versus NetBSD posts on Usenet is roughly in ratio of 5 to 1. Therefore there are about 7000/5 = 1400 NetBSD users. BSD/OS posts on Usenet are about half of the volume of NetBSD posts. Therefore there are about 700 users of BSD/OS. A recent article put FreeBSD at about 80 percent of the *BSD market. Therefore there are (7000+1400+700)*4 = 36400 FreeBSD users. This is consistent with the number of FreeBSD Usenet posts.<br><br>Fact: the *BSDs have balkanized yet again. There are now no less than twelve separate, competing *BSD projects, each of which has introduced fundamental incompatibilities with the other *BSDs, and frequently with Unix standards. Average number of developers in each project: fewer than five. Average number of users per project: there are no definitive numbers, but reports show that all projects are on the decline.<br><br>Fact: DragonflyBSD, yet another offshoot of the beleaguered FreeBSD &quot;project&quot;, is already collapsing under the weight of internal power struggles and in-fighting. &quot;They haven&#039;t done a single decent release,&quot; notes Mark Baron, an industry watcher and columnist. &quot;Their mailing lists read like an online version of a Jerry Springer episode, complete with food fights, swearing, name-calling, and chair-throwing.&quot; Netcraft reports that DragonflyBSD is run on exactly 0% of internet servers.<br><br><br>Fact: There are almost no FreeBSD developers left, and its use, according to Netcraft, is down to a sadly crippled .005% of internet servers. A recent attempt at a face-to-face summit in Boulder, Colorado culminated in an out-and-out fistfight between core developers, reportedly over code commenting formats (tabs vs. spaces). Hotel security guards broke up the melee and banned the participants from the hotel. Two of the developers were hospitalized, and one continues to have his jaw wired shut.",

For example Wheezy is still running Libre Office 2.6.7 on its compiled sourced list, and Libre Office is now at 4. something. Anything below 4 has bug with anti-aliasing where xlsx borders shows up in Libre way thicker compared to Excel. So if you&#039;re running stable you need to make backport of Libre office 4 because most of the time, the newer app requires multiple lib package dependencies that is also not on stable.<br><br>Another example I have is Clementine is now at 1.2.3 for almost everyone, but Clem 1.2.3 for debian is still Sid only. Again need to make backport for wheezy",
